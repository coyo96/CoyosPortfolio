            <h2 class="heading"> About <span>Me</span> </h2>
            <h3>Web Designer | Photoshop Aficionado | Full Stack Dev </h3><BR>
            <p> My love for graphic design began at the age of 10. My mom's friend Mitch  gifted
                me a CD-Rom of Photoshop one night after kung-fu class. This was a start of getting a copy every single year.
                That and my Pumba & Simone keyboard-typing games pointed me toward a rabbit hole that would stay with me.

                <!-- When Neopets came into my view, I was barely 9 Â½  when I discovered that part of the internet, where Myspace and"+  " <3 :P <^_^>" + " became a thing?"; 
                This was around the same time I discovered Neopets- and that someone had -->
                added a simple textarea HTML code, with a message, ontop of their
                feather-edged image of space. Function <i> and </i> art? As a creative being with no where to go, I
                quickly became obsessed with layering images together and dissecting other people's CSS codes. This led
                me to design guild layouts for my friends online after school, to nowadays helping small businesses
                design package labels for their hopefully businesses!
                <BR><BR>
                My life led me in other directions, as I battled with the urge to be an artist and my mother's hopes of
                me becoming a doctor. It wasn't until recent years that I decided to take a step towards actually pursuing
                front-end development (I mean, c'mon, open wounds give me the ick!). And
                now I am building my portfolio and taking into consideration how I can use my voice, art history, and dev-skills to
                build things to sculpt with the internet.

Rumor has it, I am actually really freaking cool. Hilarious, funny, and down-right witty.
 Wondering what fun a little mayhem could be, I like to think of the World Wide web as an opportunity to have an opinion. 
 
 Of course paired with silly rhymes. More of my history as an artist goes back down to my absolute Me. Being a child was my all time favorite part of being alive, 
 growing up was not in my agenda, and I had no interest in changing that.
 Extra hours after school, I would sit on my laptop and learn every feature that photoshop could. The Marquee tools and the blending modes were my <i>creme de la crem.</i>

 Do I have any of these ancient codes I speak of? The visual blocks of color that I apparently thought to be oh-so-i-<i>cool</i>? No! <strike>Because my 
 sacred petpages were <i>not</i> protected under Neopia's watch!</strike> Partly isso how cool can a middle school kid's prized virtual pet user-lookup be?
 <small>For the record, the answer is very.</small>
 <h3>
    Well listen, the sparkly cursors and absolutely awesome animations are making a comeback. Media is about to be taken by storm, as soon as I get my hands on an entire team to work alongside
    me creating something GREAT!

 </h3> Leading a team is one of my strongsuits. I am great at recognizing what other qualities my co-team have, and pairing us up into dynamic duos that
 work faster with glee!
