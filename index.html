            <h3>Web Designer | Photoshop Aficionado | Full Stack Dev </h3><BR>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Coyo, I am a passionate software developer and creative graphic designer with a
                penchant for turning ideas into stunning digital realities. Welcome to my corner of the web, where
                technology and artistry intersect to create something truly exceptional.
            </p>
            <h3>Software Designer by Day</h3>
            <p> By day, I'm a software developer with a focus on crafting elegant and efficient solutions to complex
                problems. My journey in the world of programming started  at the age of 10. I was on a virtual pet site when 
                I saw my first use of <b>textarea</b> on a 300px square image taken from google.  I've honed my skills in various programming languages, 
                including HTML/CSS, Java, Javascript, SQL, and Object Oriented Programming, and I thrive on challenges that require innovative thinking and meticulous
                attention to detail.

            </p>
            <h3>Graphic Designer by Night</h3>
            <p>
                When the sun sets, my creative spirit comes alive. I'm a graphic designer with a passion for visual
                storytelling. While I may not have a portfolio here (yet), my design journey has been just as exciting.
                I've worked on a wide range of projects, from branding and logo design to creating captivating user
                interfaces. Every project is an opportunity to blend aesthetics with functionality, and I believe that
                design should not only be visually striking but also user-centric.
            </p>
            <h3>The Intersection of Art and Code</h3>
            <p>
                What sets me apart is my ability to seamlessly bridge the gap between art and code. I bring a unique
                perspective to my work, infusing creativity into every line of code and designing user experiences that
                are not only intuitive but also visually engaging. Whether it's crafting an elegant algorithm or
                refining the pixel-perfect details of a design, I approach every task with passion and dedication.


                I'm driven by the belief that technology can be beautiful, and design can be functional. My mission is
                to create digital experiences that inspire, inform, and connect. I'm constantly seeking new challenges
                and opportunities to grow as a developer and designer, and I'm excited to bring my skills to projects
                that make a difference.

                <br>

                Whether you're looking to collaborate on a software project, need a fresh design perspective, or just
                want to connect with a fellow enthusiast, I'd love to hear from you. Together, we can turn ideas into
                reality and create something truly amazing.

                Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to the possibility of working with you to bring
                your vision to life.
            </p>
            <h3>My Goals </h3>
            <p> Currently I am spending my time researching and expanding upon my skills. I am delving into Figma,
                designing mockups and working on a passion project that will inspire others to grow their own food.

            </P>

                <p>
                    I'm inspired by nature and blocks of color, just like Web Development. Creating a home-screen with
                    comforting texts and sure personality are fun and game! Brand Identity plays a big role here, and
                    I'd love to help start your mission

                    Rumor has it, I am actually really freaking cool. Hilarious, funny, and down-right witty.
                    Wondering what fun a little mayhem could be, I like to think of the World Wide web as an opportunity
                    to have an opinion.

                    Of course paired with silly rhymes. More of my history as an artist goes back down to my absolute
                    Me. Being a child was my all time favorite part of being alive,
                    growing up was not in my agenda, and I had no interest in changing that.
                    Extra hours after school, I would sit on my laptop and learn every feature that photoshop could. The
                    Marquee tools and the blending modes were my <i>creme de la crem.</i>

                    Do I have any of these ancient codes I speak of? The visual blocks of color that I apparently
                    thought to be oh-so-i-<i>cool</i>? No! <strike>Because my
                        sacred petpages were <i>not</i> protected under Neopia's watch!</strike> Partly isso how cool
                    can a middle school kid's prized virtual pet user-lookup be?
                    <small>For the record, the answer is very.</small>
                    <h3>
                        Well listen, the sparkly cursors and absolutely awesome animations are making a comeback. Media
                        is about to be taken by storm, as soon as I get my hands on an entire team to work alongside
                        me creating something GREAT!

                    </h3> Leading a team is one of my strongsuits. I am great at recognizing what other qualities my
                    co-team have, and pairing us up into dynamic duos that
                    work faster with glee!
